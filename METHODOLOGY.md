# CHAPTER-4 METHODOLOGY

## 4.1 DATA COLLECTION

For the ResumeSeeker project, data collection primarily involves user-uploaded resumes in PDF or DOCX formats. The system is designed to process these documents and extract relevant information for analysis. While the system doesn't require pre-existing training data for its core functionality, it leverages pre-trained AI models from OpenAI for text analysis and parsing.

The system stores uploaded resumes in a structured file system, organizing them by username in the data/resumes directory. This approach ensures proper data management and easy retrieval for processing and analysis.

## 4.2 DATA PRE-PROCESSING

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fundamental component of the ResumeSeeker system, enabling the extraction and analysis of textual data from resumes. Since resume data is highly unstructured, comprehensive text preparation is essential before any meaningful analysis can be performed.

The following pre-processing steps are implemented in the ResumeSeeker system:

### 1. Text Extraction

The initial step involves extracting raw text from uploaded PDF or DOCX files. This is handled by the `/api/resumes/extract-text` endpoint, which uses appropriate libraries to convert document formats into plain text while preserving the semantic structure as much as possible.

### 2. Tokenization

Tokenization divides the extracted text into smaller, meaningful units (tokens) such as words, phrases, or sentences. This process is crucial for further analysis as it breaks down complex text into manageable components. The system employs advanced tokenization techniques to accurately identify different sections of a resume, such as personal information, work experience, education, and skills.

### 3. Removing Stop Words

To reduce noise in the data, common stop words (e.g., "the", "a", "an", "in") are removed from the text. These words appear frequently but provide little semantic value for resume analysis. By eliminating stop words, the system can focus on meaningful content that better represents the candidate's qualifications and experience.

### 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

The system uses Named Entity Recognition to identify and categorize key entities in the resume, such as:
- Person names
- Organization names
- Dates and time periods
- Educational institutions
- Job titles
- Skills and technologies

This structured information forms the basis for the resume parsing process.

### 5. Normalization

Text normalization ensures consistency across different resumes by:
- Converting all text to lowercase
- Standardizing date formats
- Normalizing job titles and skill descriptions
- Handling abbreviations and acronyms

### 6. Skill Extraction and Classification

A specialized component of the pre-processing pipeline focuses on identifying and categorizing skills mentioned in the resume. This involves:
- Matching against a comprehensive skills database
- Categorizing skills (technical, soft, domain-specific)
- Assessing skill relevance and proficiency levels where indicated

## 4.3 MODULE IMPLEMENTATION

The ResumeSeeker project is built using a modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes code reusability. The implementation leverages various libraries and frameworks to provide a robust and scalable solution.

### 1. Next.js Framework

Next.js serves as the foundation of the application, providing both frontend and backend capabilities. It enables server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO, while also supporting API routes for backend functionality.

### 2. React Components

The user interface is built using React 18, with a component-based architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability. Key components include:
- **ResumeUploader**: Handles file selection and upload
- **Dashboard**: Displays user's resumes and provides management options
- **Resume Detail View**: Shows comprehensive resume information and analysis

### 3. Authentication Module

User authentication is implemented using NextAuth.js, providing secure login/registration functionality and session management. This module ensures that user data remains private and that only authorized users can access protected resources.

### 4. File Storage System

A structured file storage system manages uploaded resume documents:
- Files are organized by username
- Original documents are preserved for reference
- Metadata is stored to track file information

### 5. Text Extraction Module

This module handles the conversion of PDF and DOCX files to plain text:
- PDF extraction uses appropriate PDF parsing libraries
- DOCX extraction converts Microsoft Word documents to text
- The module preserves document structure where possible

### 6. AI Integration Module

The AI integration module connects with OpenAI's API to perform advanced text analysis:
- Parses unstructured resume text into structured data
- Identifies key resume components (personal info, experience, education, skills)
- Extracts relevant information from each section

### 7. Database Module

Prisma ORM provides type-safe database access for storing and retrieving:
- User information
- Resume metadata
- Parsed resume content
- Analysis results

### 8. API Routes

Next.js API routes implement the backend functionality:
- `/api/resumes/upload`: Handles file uploads
- `/api/resumes/extract-text`: Processes documents for text extraction
- `/api/resumes/parse`: Analyzes and structures resume content
- `/api/resumes`: Retrieves user's resumes
- `/api/resumes/[id]`: Manages individual resume operations

### 9. Job Matching Module (Planned)

This module will implement algorithms to match resume content with job requirements:
- Skill matching
- Experience relevance assessment
- Education qualification matching
- Overall suitability scoring

### 10. Skill Gap Analysis Module (Planned)

The skill gap analysis module will:
- Compare user skills against job requirements
- Identify missing or underdeveloped skills
- Generate recommendations for skill development
- Provide personalized improvement plans

The modular approach allows for independent development and testing of each component, facilitating maintenance and future enhancements. The system architecture promotes scalability, allowing new features to be added without significant refactoring of existing code.
